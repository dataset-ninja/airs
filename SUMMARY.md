**AIRS: Aerial Imagery for Roof Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the environmental industry. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the urban planning industry. 

The dataset consists of 1046 images with 880 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*roof*).

Images in the AIRS dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 166 (16% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (95 images), *train* (857 images), and *val* (94 images). The dataset was released in 2018 by the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), University of Waterloo, University of Tokyo, and AtlasAI Inc.
